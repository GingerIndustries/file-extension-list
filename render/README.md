# File Extension List render scripts

The shell script [list](list) will print a list of
categories and extensions associated on each line.

The shell scripts [json-categories](json-categories) and
[json-extensions](json-extensions) will produce key/value maps
per-category and per-extension like those distributed in
[pub](../pub).

The shell script [build-ext2cat](build-ext2cat) renders another shell
script that be used to quickly categorize files on the command-line.
